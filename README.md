**Project Title:**  
*Converting Arbitrary Images to Pixel Art Mosaics With Constrained Palettes*

**Project Description:**  
> This software engineering project aims to automate the process of converting any arbitrary image file into a pixel art representation of a user's specifications. Additionally, it aims to do so with the use of constrained palettes of natural colors, like those of plants, flowers, and stones, rather than the traditional 8, 16, or 24-bit RGB palettes used in video games.
> 
> The research methodology of this project includes an examination of various existing algorithms to match the original image colors to constrained palettes and, if possible within time constraints, a comparison of techniques to convert an image to a compressed mosaic image while preserving the look of the original image. It will be programmed primarily in Python and developed and deployed as a web application.
> 
> The outcome of this research will be a working software prototype that can be used to create pixel art images. This technology can help make the generation of art images more accessible to a broader audience and assist artists and software developers in understanding the underlying processes of pixel art creation.
